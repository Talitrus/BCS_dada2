# BCS Pipeline Documentation

This README serves as a virtual lab notebook. We will document the scripts and the order that they're run in on here.

## Setup
First, make a file in the main directory (one level above this directory) called `libraries.txt` containing a name of each directory containing sequence data (FASTQ) files from Illumina runs.
The main directory should also contain a tab-separated value file called key.txt that contains information corresponding library number, adapter index number (sample number from the Illumina run), and primer tag number to ML ID numbers and other sample metadata.

## Run Order
1. make\_file\_root\_list.sh
2. flexbar.sh
3. flexbar2.sh

## R Analysis with DADA2
### Setup
Make a subdirectory in the main directory called `R`.
R scripts can be placed here. Code for renaming files generated by flexbar2.sh will be contained here as well as R code for running DADA2 analysis.

### Run Order
0. rename.sh
1. dada2\_analysis.sh
2. dada2\_removechim.sh
3. BCS\_phyloseq.sh
